The xlsx files contains for each cluster of syntactically equivalent automatons (ids of the submission) a half
automatically classification.
Two automatons are syntactically equivalent automatons if and only if one can be translated to the other only by
renaming
of the states.
Note that before this test all non-productive states and non-alphabet transitions are removed from the automatons.

Classifications:

- 0 = no approach recognizable
- 1 = approach recognizable but big mistakes in the construction
- 2 = approach recognizable but little mistakes in the construction
- 3 = submission recognize the correct language

half automatically because the separation between class 3 and the other classes
was computed by an automatic equivalence test.
